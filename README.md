# EEG Clustering and Model Evaluation

## Overview
This project explores EEG feature clustering using the K-Means algorithm and evaluates clustering performance using metrics such as cohesion and silhouette score.

## Features
- **EEG Data Processing**: Preprocess and extract relevant features from EEG signals.
- **K-Means Clustering**: Apply K-Means to group EEG feature sets.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Compute cohesion (within-cluster variance) and silhouette score (cluster separation and compactness).
- **Visualization**: Generate plots to illustrate clustering results.

## Requirements
Ensure you have the following installed:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
